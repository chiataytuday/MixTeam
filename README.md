# MixTeam

>MixTeam is an old project started in late 2017 and maintained just for my personal usage until mid 2018.
>I want now to migrate this project to modern Swift 5 and SwiftUI, and also publish it.

⚠️ MixTeam name will certainly change, as I don't know yet if this name is already taken by another app.

## TODO

* Add Linter rules
* Migrate views to SwiftUI
* Add Unit Tests with Snapshots for views
* Improve UI
* Add GitHub Actions CI
* *etc.*
